# AIJ_SQL_Practice
This project includes SQL practice questions I solved to improve data querying, analysis, and database skills. SQL is essential for AI and Data Science because ML workflows begin with extracting and preparing data. These exercises strengthened my analytical thinking for AI projects.

📝 Overview:
This project contains a collection of SQL practice questions and solutions designed to strengthen my skills in data querying, analysis, filtering, aggregation, and database operations. SQL is a fundamental skill for AI, Data Science, and Analytics because real-world ML workflows always begin with extracting, cleaning, and understanding data.

🎯 Why This Project?
🔍 To build a strong foundation in SQL for data manipulation and preprocessing
🧠 To strengthen analytical thinking and problem-solving
🤖 To prepare for AI/ML workflows where data handling is crucial
🗂️ To practice real-world database operations (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, Window Functions, etc.)

📂 Dataset Used:
File: Sales_data.csv
Used for generating 50–60 SQL practice questions
Loaded into PostgreSQL (pgAdmin) for hands-on learning

🛠️ Technologies Used
🐘 PostgreSQL
🖥️ pgAdmin
📄 CSV Dataset
🧭 SQL concepts from beginner → advanced

📚 What I Practiced
✔️ Basic SQL queries
✔️ Filtering, sorting, and pattern matching
✔️ Aggregations & GROUP BY
✔️ JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
✔️ Subqueries
✔️ Window Functions
✔️ CTEs (WITH clause)
✔️ Date & string functions
✔️ Constraints and schema understanding

🔥 Key Learnings:
📌 How to extract meaningful insights using SQL
📌 How SQL becomes the first stage of any AI/ML process
📌 How to clean, filter, and transform data before modeling
📌 Improved logic-building and query optimization mindset
